# SpacetimeDB Bindings Generation

## Prerequisites

-   You have the [SpacetimeDB SDK addon](installation.md) installed in your Godot project
-   A SpacetimeDB module published to a SpacetimeDB server  
    _The codegen tool uses the SpacetimeDB API to generate all types and reducers_

> Note: Every table in your SpacetimeDB module must have a primary key for the local database and deserialization to work correctly.

## Generate module bindings

1. Open the SpacetimeDB tab in the bottom dock
2. Replace the default URL with your serverâ€™s URL

3. Click "Check URI" to verify the addon can reach your server
4. Enter your module name and click the `+` button

5. You can now click the `Generate schema` button to generate the bindings, all generated code is placed in `res://spacetime_bindings/`

## Generated bindings structure

The generated bindings are placed in `res://spacetime_bindings/` and are structured as follows:

-   `codegen_debug` contains the parsed SpacetimeDB schema for debugging purposes, you can delete this folder if you want.
-   `schema` contains all of the generated bindings for your SpacetimeDB module.
    -   `schema/types` and `schema/module_*_types.gd` contains all of your SpacetimeDB types, table structs and enums, these are using by the BSATN deserializer.
    -   `schema/tables` and `schema/module_*_db.gd` contains the a representation of your module's tables allowing you to easily query the local database.
    -   `schema/module_*_reducers.gd` contains all of the reducer functions for your module.
    -   `schema/module_*_client.gd` is the spacetimedb client for your module which handles the SpacetimeDB connection and exposes the database and reducers.
-   `codegen_config.json` contains the configuration for codegen, modify this file to change what code is generated.
-   `codegen_data.json` the saved state of the plugin UI, do not edit this file directly.
